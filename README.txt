README - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Data ProcessingOverviewThis repository contains an R script, run_analysis.R, that processes the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The script performs the following operations:1. Merges the training and test datasets into a single dataset.2. Extracts only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.3. Assigns descriptive activity names to replace numeric activity labels.4. Labels the dataset with meaningful variable names.5. Creates a tidy dataset containing the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.Dataset InformationThe HAR dataset contains sensor readings from the accelerometers and gyroscopes of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones. The data was collected from 30 subjects performing six different activities.Data Sources* Training Data: X_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt* Test Data: X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_test.txt* Feature Names: features.txt* Activity Labels: activity_labels.txtRequirementsTo run run_analysis.R, you need:* R (version 4.0 or higher)* Required package: dplyrInstall dplyr if not already installed:install.packages("dplyr")Running the Script1. Download and extract the HAR dataset from UCI HAR Dataset.2. Place the extracted dataset in your working directory.3. Run the script in R:source("run_analysis.R")4. The script outputs a tidy dataset df_ave, which contains the average of each selected measurement for each subject and activity.Output* Final Tidy Dataset: df_aveo Each row represents a unique Subject and ActivityName.o Each column contains the mean value of a selected measurement.CreditsThe Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset was collected and made available by the Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory at the Universitˆ degli Studi di Genova. The dataset is publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
